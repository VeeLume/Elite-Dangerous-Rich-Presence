**Which ship is missing**
Important are the name of the ship and the internal name

**Upload files**
Either:
- go to a shipyard that sells the ship and upload the shipyard.json
- if you own the ship upload the journal*.log with the FID stripped / post an event which contains both the internal name (usually just the field Ship or ShipType) and the localized name (the field name with _Localized)

**(Optional) Create a pull request**
If your familliar with github and json files then you can also just add the ship in the vessels.json file inside elite_dangerous_rich_presence

**(Optional) Upload an asset**
Currently all assets are from edassets.org, which unfortunatly doesnt seem to be maintained anymore. So if you like to have an image for the ship uploading a image would be appreciated, as im bad at graphics.
